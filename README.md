# Plasmadispersionfunction
The Hilbert Transform of the Gaussian focuses on the reactions, transformations, and calculations involved in plasma dispersion function. This notebook first offers information on the properties of Z, including symmetry properties, values for special arguments, power series, asymptotic expansion, and differential equation characterization.
